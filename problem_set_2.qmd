## Question 1

*Points: 5*

Using the `states` data, produce a scatterplot of the variables `womleg_2015` and `libpct_m` (with `womleg_2015` as the dependent variable on the y-axis). Describe the scatterplot and include a copy of it. Note any suspected outliers, if any (a visual inspection will suffice for this question). Lastly, give the general equation for the correlation between `womleg_2015` and `libpct_m` (include as much information as possible), but do not solve it.

::: callout-note
The `states` data set can be found in `poliscidata::states`. Take a look at `?states` to see what these variables measure.
:::

```{r}

ggplot(data = poliscidata::states, aes(x = libpct_m, y = womleg_2015)) +
  geom_point() +  
  labs(x = "Frequency Mass Public Liberal", y = "Women Legislator in 2015") +  
  ggtitle("Scatterplot") 

cor(states$womleg_2015, states$libpct_m)

?states
```


Answer: 

Scatter plot shows positive correlation between the percent mass public Liberal variable and the Women in State legislates variable with some outliers in the data that cannot be explicitly determined by the plot itself. 


 Equation: 

$$ Correlation Coeffienct = Σ (womleg_2015 - womleg_2015) / √Σ(womleg_2015 - womleg_2015)^2 - Σ(libpct_m - libpct_m Mean $$ 




## Question 2

*Points: 5*

Regress `womleg_2015` (as the dependent variable) on `libpct_m` and report the results in a professionally formatted table. Write the model equation with the estimated coefficients and interpret them. What does the value of $R^2$ tell us about this model?

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(poliscidata)


regress_m_1 <- lm(womleg_2015 ~ libpct_m, states)
regress_m_1

modelsummary(
  regress_m_1, 
  statistic = NULL,
  coef_rename = c("libpct_m" = "Public_liberal"),
  gof_map = "nobs"
)

summary(regress_m_1)

glance(regress_m_1)



```
Answer:


Model Equation ~ Y = wom_leg2015 + libpct_m(X)


$$ Y = 1.52 + 1.15(libpct_m) $$
R Squared is .3707 which means there is a weak relationship in this regression
model and does not allow us to have much confidence in Y being explained by X.





## Question 3

*Points: 5*

Based on this regression, find the predicted value, the observed value, and compute the residual for the state of Colorado and then the state of Georgia. Lastly, compute the total aggregate error from those two select observations combined (i.e., Colorado and Georgia).

# Colorado
  Predicted Value : 26.37
  Observed Value : 21.68
  Residual : 4.69

# Georgia
  Predicted Value : 21.71
  Observed Value : 17.612
  Residual : 4.1

# Total Aggregate Error
The total aggregate error for Colorado and Georgia is .59.

## Question 4

*Points: 5*

Using the `states` dataset, assess the relationship between the following two variables: `obama_win12` and `gun_rank3`. Construct a cross-tab and describe the nature of the relationship (if any) in detail.

::: callout-note
The variable `Obama_win12` is a dichotomous indicator of whether Obama won the state in 2012 (Obama won; Obama lost). The variable `gun_rank3` represents the general (ordinal) extent of gun restrictions in each state (more restrictions; middle restrictions; less restrictions).

```{r}

library(poliscidata)
library(modelsummary)

cross_tab <- table(states$obama_win12, states$gun_rank3)

print(cross_tab)

```
The cross tab indicates that President Obama won more states in the 2012
election in states that have more restrictive guns laws as opposed to those with
less restrictive guns laws. This was indicate a strong association between the 
two variables



## Question 5

*Points: 5*

I hypothesize that religious identifiers in the mass public are less likely to support federal government support of scientific research. I use data from the General Social Survey to evaluate this hypothesis. In particular, I use a three-category indicator of religious attendance to measure religious identification (low attendance; moderate attendance; high attendance) and a three-category indicator of perceptions toward the federal government's support for scientific research (federal government provides "too little" support; "about right"; federal government provides "too much" support). Complete the cross-tab below so that you may properly evaluate my hypothesis.

::: callout-note
Table entries are raw counts of observations within each cell.

![](img/ps2_cross_tab.png)
Answer:

                        Support for Scientific Reserach
Religious Attendance | Too Little ~ About Right ~ Too Much |    Total
--------------------
                  Low |     342         356          106          804 
              Moderate|     190         213           51          454
                  High|     182         287           91          560
                Total |     714(38.27%) 856(47.98)    248(13.64) 1818 
                
                
The hypothesis for this study, as indicated by the data in the cross table, is 
weak and inconclusive. There is far more people who indicate the government
either supports scientific research too little (38%) or about right (47%) than those who
would indicate the government support for science is too large (~14%).

## Question 6

*Points: 5*

Say I wish to explore the relationship between the relative advantage of Democrats (`dem_advantage`) in a state and abortion policy (`abort_rank3`). The `dem_advantage` variable is a continuous indicator where higher values represent a greater Democratic advantage among the mass public; `abort_rank3` is an ordinal indicator for the extent of abortion restrictions in each state (fewer restrictions; middle restrictions; more restrictions). To explore this relationship, complete the following:

### Part A

Create a new variable (i.e., `dem_adv`) based on the `dem_advantage` variable. Calculate the summary statistics of `dem_advantage` and assign the following values to our new variable: if `dem_advantage` is less than the first quartile, set `dem_adv` to `Low`; if the value for `dem_advantage` is greater than the first quartile and less than the third quartile, set the value to `Mid`; and if the value of `dem_advantage` is greater than the third quartile, set the value to `High`.

```{r}

quartiles <- quantile(states$dem_advantage, probs = c(0.25, 0.75))
quartiles

states <- states <- states %>%
  mutate(dem_adv = case_when(
    dem_advantage < quartiles[1] ~ "Low",
    dem_advantage >= quartiles[1] & dem_advantage < quartiles[2] ~ "Mid",
    dem_advantage > quartiles[2] ~ "High"
  ))

summary(states$dem_advantage)


 
```

### Part B

Create a crosstab using R; include your results in a professionally formatted table.

```{r}

datasummary_crosstab(abort_rank3 ~ dem_adv, data = states)




```

### Part C

What relationship (if any) is there between the relative advantage of Democrats is a given state and the restrictiveness of Abortion policy?

Answer: The cross table indicates that the democratic party has high advantage in states that restricted abortion (56.2%) as well has a high advantage in states with more restrictied abortion policies (64.7%). Overall,  the democrats have a majority meduim amount of advantage across all states.
