## Question 1

*Total points: 10*

I hypothesize that the older someone is, the more they like watching golf. I conduct a survey based on an SRS of adults in America. The independent variable is a four-category measure of age: 21-35, 36-50, 51-65, 66-plus. The dependent variable is a three-category measure of how much they enjoy watching golf: not at all, somewhat, very much.

### Part A

*Points: 4*

Make a cross-tab, by hand, of the relationship between these two variables based on the following (completely made up) data. Make sure that you present both raw counts and the appropriate percentages to examine the relationship.

### Part B

*Points: 2*

Does the data support my hypothesis? Be sure to explain the nature of the relationship (or lack thereof, if relevant).

Based on the Crosstab we can see a mild correlation between someone age and the frequency in which they watch golf. For example in age groups 51-64 and 66+ we can see a significantly higher percentage of those who what golf "very much" (33.33%) compared to those aged 21-35 ( 8.3%) and a notable differences between those 36-50 (25%). However due to the low sample size and the majority of answer being in the "somewhat" category, there is not enough strong information to support the hypothesis.

### Part C

*Points: 2*

Compute (by hand) the chi-square statistic to test the null hypothesis of no relationship between these two variables. Be sure to show your work.

H(0) - there is no association between age and the frequency of viewing of golf

H(A) - there is a strong association between age and the strength of viewership of golf

### Part D

*Points: 2*

Using the chi-square statistic that you computed in question 1(c), can you reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between these two variables with 95% confidence? Why, or why not?

With a Chi value of 6.1443 for a 95% confidence level and 6 degrees of freedom. The critical value at a 95% confidence level with 6 degrees of freedom is approximately 12.592.

Since our calculated chi-square statistic (6.1443) is less than the critical value (12.592), we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at a 95% confidence level. This means that, with 95% confidence, you cannot conclude that there is a significant relationship between age and the enjoyment of watching golf based on the data we collected.

## Question 2

*Points: 10*

I hypothesize that people who identify as more liberal are less likely to see gun control as an important issue than people who identify as more conservative. Using the `nes` dataset from the `poliscidata` package, create a cross-tab examining the effect of someone's self-identification as liberal or conservative, measured using the variable `libcon3` variable, and their indication of how important gun access is to them as an issue, measured using the `gun_importance3` variable.

Do the data support my hypothesis? Be sure to explain the nature of the relationship (or lack thereof, if relevant). Report a chi-square statistic (it is fine to have R generate the statistic and p-value). What does the chi-square statistic tell you about whether you can reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between these two variables with 95% confidence? Why, or why not?

```{r}

library(poliscidata)
library(modelsummary)

datasummary_crosstab(libcon3 ~ gun_importance3, data = nes)

chisq.test(nes$libcon3, nes$gun_importance3)





```

With a Chi-Square value of 40.105, that indicates there is a very strong relationship between political affiliation and attitudes towards gun control. Further more with a P value of 4.118e -08 that is so close to 0 shows a high degree of correlation between the two variables in the data. With a confidence level of 95% (.05) and such as small P value we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between being a liberal or conservative and the importance of gun control.
