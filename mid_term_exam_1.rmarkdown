Five Number Summary:

```         
Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  62.00   65.50   68.50   68.75   72.00   76.00 
```

### Question 2

A.  76
B.  62
C.  **83**
D.  Both (A) and (C)
E.  All of the above
F.  None of the above, or cannot be determined from the information given.

As

### Question 3

*1 point*

There is a group of three children with the following ages: 3, 4, and 5. If a 6-year-old child joins the group, what will happen to the mean and standard deviation of the group's age?

Answer:

If a 6 year old child enters the groups the mean will increase (3+4+5/3=4 vs. 3+4+5+6/4 +4.5) and the standard deviation will decrease as more values are added to the group.

### Question 4

*1 point*

If I estimate an OLS regression and obtain a $R^2$ of 0.40 where the Total Sum of Squares of 4,150, what does the Residual Sum of Squares equal?

Answer:

The Residual Sum of Squares is equal to 2,490. Since $R^2$ = TSS (Total Sum Squares)/ SSR ( Sum of Squares Regression) and we know the $R^2$ value and TSS value we can solve for the missing SSR and then find the missing Residual Sum of Squares by subtracting from the SSR .

SSR = .4 x 4,150

1,660 = SSR

4,150 - 1,660 = 2,490

### Question 5

*1 point*

The distribution of some variable has a median that is smaller than its mean. Which of the following statements about the distribution's shape is most consistent with this information?

A.  The shape of the distribution would be symmetric

B.  The shape of the distribution would be skewed left

C.  **The shape of the distribution would be skewed right**

D.  None of the above -- cannot be determined from the information given.

### Question 6

*1 point*

Suppose I want to test the hypothesis that the U.S. public's approval of the president is higher when people have more positive perceptions of the U.S. economy. To test this hypothesis, I conduct a survey of individual-level attitudes. Which of the following research design strategies should I expect to exhibit both the greatest sampling variability (in the context of repeated sampling) and the lowest degree of expected sampling bias?

A.  **A random sample of 1,200 people from a list of all U.S. residential addresses**
B.  A random sample of 600 people from a list of all registered students at the University of Maryland
C.  A random sample of 1,200 people from a list of all registered students at the University of Maryland
D.  A random sample of 600 people from a list of all U.S. residential addresses.

### Question 7

*1 point*

The median age of ten people in a room is 50 years. One 40-year-old person leaves the room. What can we expect will happen to the median age for the remaining nine people? Do we know the median age of those nine people; if so, what is it?

Answer:

The median will either change to more than 50 years, if the 40 year old was the oldest in the room or stay the same. At this point we cant determine the new median of those nine other people since we don't know the ages of the remaining nine people in the room

### Question 8

*1 point*

The mean age of ten people in a room is 50 years. One 70-years-old person leaves the room. What can we expect will happen to the mean age for the remaining nine people? Do we know the mean age of those nine people; if so, what is it?

Answer:

As we know the number of values and the mean we can solve for the new mean after the 70 year old person has left the room. The new mean of the remaining nine people in the group will be around 47.78.

50 = X/10 \~ 500 500-70 = 430 430/9= 47.78.

### Question 9

*1 point*

Which of the following sets of numbers has the largest standard deviation?

A.  **2, 4, 6, 8**
B.  7, 8, 9, 10
C.  5, 5, 5, 5
D.  1, 2, 3, 5

### Question 10

*6 points*

I hypothesize that people with greater social trust are more likely to turnout to vote in American national elections. I use data from the 2012 General Social Survey to examine how respondents' self-reported level of social trust might be correlated with their decisions to vote. In particular, I use the `social_trust` variable (i.e., a 4-point ordinal indicator of social trust -- larger values reflect greater trust) and the `vote08` variable (i.e., a dichotomous indicator where a `1` indicates that the respondent voted) to test my hypothesis.

Complete the cross-tab below so that you may properly evaluate my hypothesis. Briefly interpret the results of your completed cross-tab. Do the data suggest that social trust is related to voting in 2008? Be sure to explain the nature of the relationship (or lack thereof, if relevant).

Answer:

Social Trust \| Vote

1 0 Total

0 257 137 394 (33%)

1 194 93 287 (24%)

2 192 56 248 (21%)

3 240 30 270 (23%)

Total 883(74%) 316(26%) 1199

The completed cross tabs indicate that irregardless of social trust more people voted than not in the 2008 election drawing doubts as to the exact correlation between trust and voting in general. Furthermore, the data shows that more people identified as having 0 or 1 social trust and voted than those whose social trust was 2 or 3, so the hypothesis that greater social trust is equal to higher voter turnout is likely to be false.

### Question 1

*10 points total*

Use the `states` dataset (the U.S. state is the unit of analysis) and estimate a bivariate regression where the size of a state's urban population (`urban`) explains variation in abortion attitudes (`permit`) and report the results in a professionally formatted table. The variable `permit` measures the percentage (on a 0-to-100 scale) of a state's population that says abortion should always be allowed. The variable `urban` measures the percentage (on a 0-to-100 scale) of a state's population in an urban area. Answer the following questions.


```{r}
library(stargazer)


data("states")


model <- lm(permit ~ urban, data = states)


summary_table <- stargazer(model, 
                            title = "Bivariate Regression: Urban Population vs. Abortion Attitudes",
                            dep.var.labels.include = FALSE, 
                            covariate.labels = c("Urban Population"),
                            type = "text"
)

cat(summary_table)



```


A.  Interpret the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. *2 points*

    Since the coefficient is positive at .373 this indicates a positive relationship between a state's urban population and it's attitude towards abortion. Therefore if urban population increase we can expect that attitudes toward abortion will also increase.

B.  Interpret the estimate of the intercept. Is it substantively meaningful to interpret this coefficient on its own? Explain why, or why not. *2 points*

    With the intercept being 9.639 and we set all the IV values to 0 we can assume that this is the value of abortion values when we have a 0 in urban population. This value is probably not meaningful by itself as it unlikely we would ever encounter a state with an urban population of 0.

C.  Compute the residual sum of squares for the following two observations combined: (1) California; and (2) Texas. *2 points*


    ```{r}

    data = states

    lm = model

    stat <- states |>
      filter(stateid%in%c("CA    ", "TX    ")) |>
      select(stateid, urban, permit)


    ```


    Answer: Residual Sum of Squares for California and Texas combined: 0

D.  How well does the model fit the data (i.e., how well can we explain abortion attitudes with this model?) *2 points*

    The $R^2$ value of this regression is .27 meaning that we can only account for 27% of the variance in how urban population explains abortion attitudes. Conversely, 73% of attitudes toward cannot be explained by the data.

E.  Is the relationship between the independent and dependent variable causal? Why or why not? *2 points*

    While there is a positive correlation between urban population and attitudes toward abortion there is not enough evidence to prove a definitive causation between the two variables. There could be confounding variables or omitted data that could effect the relationship between the two or more rigorous study could determine the two have a spurious relationship.

### Question 2

*5 points*

Use the `gss` data set (the unit of analysis is the individual survey respondent) and evaluate the hypothesis that Republicans had less confidence in the executive branch of the federal government than Democrats in 2012. Use the following variables: `partyid` is a 7-category ordinal indicator (0 = Strong Democrat; 1 = Weak Democrat; 2 = Independent Democrat; 3 = Independent; 4 = Independent Republican; 5 = Weak Republican; 6 = Strong Republican); and `confed` is a 3-category ordinal indicator (1 = "a great deal" of confidence; 2 = "only some;" 3 = "hardly any"). Do the data support the hypothesis and how do you know?


```{r}

gss <- filter(gss, year == 2012)


cross_tab <- table (gss$partyid, gss$confed)
cross_tab
```


Answer:

The cross tab shows that in 2012 only a handful of republicans has a great deal of trust in the executive branch compared to those who identified as a democrat. Therefore we can support the general hypothesis that republicans had a less amount of confidence in the executive branch in 2012 than the democrats.

### Question 3

*5 points*

Use the `world` dataset and evaluate the distributions for each the following variables: `literacy` (a country's literacy rate) and `free_overall` (a country's degree of economic freedom). Be sure to visually display each distribution and thoroughly describe their key attributes. Next, evaluate the bivariate relationship between the two variables -- i.e., is economic freedom associated with literacy? If so, what is the nature of the relationship and how do you know? In doing so, be sure to use proper descriptive tools (and thus do not rely simply on a regression output).


```{r}


library(ggplot2)

# Distribution for Literacy

ggplot(world, aes(x = literacy)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Literacy Rates",
       x = "Literacy Rate",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

# Distribution for free_overall

ggplot(world, aes(x = free_overall)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "green", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Economic Freedom",
       x = "Economic Freedom Score",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()


# Bivariate Relationship

ggplot(world, aes(x = literacy, y = free_overall)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +  
  labs(title = "Bivariate Relationship between Literacy and Economic Freedom",
       x = "Literacy Rate",
       y = "Economic Freedom Score") +
  theme_minimal()

model <- lm(free_overall ~ literacy, data = world)

summary(model)







```


Answer:

The distribution of Literacy Rates shows a distribution that is highly skewed to the left with most of the values falling between 75% and 100% in a states literacy race. The `free_overall` variable that show economic freedom has a more centered distribution with a slight skew to the left. The bivariate relationship between shows a positive but relatively weak relationship between the two variables as the scatter plot shows. The regression output provided a coefficient of 0.234 which also supports the claim that there is a positive but weak relationship between the two variables.
